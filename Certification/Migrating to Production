Phase 3 Certification

During the certification phase your integration team will be responsible for sequentially completing the objectives in the certification script provided. Your team should now be intimately familiar with the Authorization Gateway and the host system should now be able to handle the completion of these objectives without any problems.  During the certification phase our software team will closely monitor each transaction to ensure it is valid, and that the host system is properly configured. We will alert you to the status of the transaction in our system and advise you if there are any modifications that need to be made to the host system. The successful completion of each objective outlined in the certification script signifies the completion of the major milestone for the Certification Phase and marks the opportunity to begin the Production Phase.
